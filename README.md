Built a minimax-driven AI for the 5Ã—5 Teeko board game, leveraging heuristic evaluation functions, weighted scoring matrices, and state-space search with pruning to choose optimal moves. Designed custom heuristics for both drop and move phases, integrating distance-based scoring functions and recursive minimax evaluation. Demonstrates strength in game theory, heuristic search algorithms, and AI decision-making.
